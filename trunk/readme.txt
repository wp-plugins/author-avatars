Adds a widget that shows avatars of the blog users so that people can see what you look like...

== Description ==

This plugin provides a widget which allows you to show avatars of blog users.

The widget can be configured to

*   show a custom title
*   only show specific user groups and/or hide certain users
*   limit the number of users shown
*   change the sort order of users or show in random order
*   adjust the size of user avatars

The plugin makes use of built in wordpress (core) functions to retrieve user information / get avatars.

1. Upload the `author-avatars` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enable and configure the widget as usual on the Design / Widgets page.

== Screenshots ==

1. Very simple set up of the widget on an empty blog... (I admit, it's just to have a screenshot at all :P)
