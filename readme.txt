== Frequently asked questions ==

= Shortcode, huh? =

A shortcode is a tag like <code>[authoravatars]</code> which you can insert into a page or post to display a list of users on that post/page. You can read more about shortcodes in general in the wordpress codex, for example [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode) or [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API).

= How do I use the author avatar shortcode? =

It's simple: just add [authoravatars] into your post and hit save!
There's also a number of [parameters](http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Bforchhammer/Author_Avatars_ShortCode_Documentation) available!
