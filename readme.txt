*   Limit the number of users shown
*   Change the sort order of users or show in random order
*   Adjust the size of user avatars

The plugin makes use of built in wordpress (core) functions to retrieve user information / get avatars.

The plugin has been developed for wpmu 2.6. and tested on wp 2.6. and wp 2.7.
